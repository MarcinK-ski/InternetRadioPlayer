# InternetRadioPlayer

- __Listen__ internet radio stream, 
- __Check__ current song name,
- __Open__ current song via YT or Spotify, to save to it in your favourite collection!

##### To add new radio station, you need to have URL to stream. Optionally, you can add URL to logo and current song info.

_This app was developed, becouse proxy at my work is blocking some stations websites, but streams works well. Although app was written __in a hurry__, I would like to try add some improvements and optimizations._
